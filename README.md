<h2>:pencil2: Project Description</h2>
<p>This project is a simple calculator implemented in JavaScript.</p> 
<p>Which can be run in the Node.js environment.</p>
<p>The calculator supports 5 basic arithmetic operations: addition; subtraction; multiplication; division; exponentiation.</p>
<p>It provides a user-friendly interface for performing calculations efficiently and accurately.</p>

<h2>:hammer: Features and Application</h2>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: To use this project, it is necessary to download both the 'main.js' file and the calculator module (calculator.js) and save them in the same folder on your computer.</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: The 'main.js' file is the main file that needs to be executed to access the calculator. The calculator module contains the necessary mathematical functions to perform the operations.</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: It is important to note that you must have Node.js installed on your computer to run the project.</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check: After downloading and saving the necessary files in the same folder, run the 'main.js' file and follow the on-screen instructions to perform the desired mathematical operations.</p>

<h2>:wrench: Install Dependencies</h2>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check:npm install</p>
<p>:ballot_box_with_check:npm install readline-sync</p>
<p>To run the program, type in the terminal:</p>
<ul>:ballot_box_with_check:node main.js</ul>

<h2>ðŸ“¦ Implantation</h2>
<p>Although it is a simple design, it can be improved by adding more mathematical operations.</p>
